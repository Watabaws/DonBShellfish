#Adam Abbas Shell Project

###Rolling list of features this shell implements!

* Basic commands (ls, echo etc)!
* CD into a directory in the program! (Will print the location)
* Seperate commands with semicolons! **Don't use spaces**: *command1;command2;command3*
* Piping! Typing in *command*  *|* *command* takes the output from the first command and inputs it into the second command!
